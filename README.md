# Homework 5 - jQuery/JavaScript Assignment - Trivia Game

### Overview

### Built With
For this assignment, I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and also Bootstrap, but just for the tiniest amount of formatting, really.


### Here's How the App Works

* On initialization, the user is presented with a button to start the game.

* A timer of 30 seconds is started, and the user is presented with a trivia question randomly pulled from an object of questions. They may choose "True" or "False" to answer these questions.

* If the user does not choose an answer before the timer runs out, the computer will store it as an unanswered question. It will then move on to the next question.

* When they click "True" or "False", they are told whether the answer was correct or wrong, and shown an image relating to the question.

* When all questions are answered, the totals of correct answers, wrong answers, and unanswered questions are totaled and presented as stats to the user. A button to reset the game without refreshing is shown to the player.
